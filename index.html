			<p class="p">Distribution companies are increasingly hearing about the digital transformation imperative for a reason. Making the technology investment is no longer optional. As explained in presentations at MDM’s 2019 Digital Distributor Summit, commoditization, competitive innovation and changing market dynamics are combining to forever alter the distributor’s traditional value proposition.</p>

			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">In order to rise to this growing challenge, speakers at the Summit recommended distributors first familiarize themselves with factors contributing to the change. Then, by understanding how their company may be holding itself back, distributors can move forward with a unified vision of what a commitment to digital distribution means for them and their customers. </p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;Distributors need to innovate or die,&rdquo; said Ian Heller, MDM president, &ldquo;because disruption has truly reached the distribution industry. It’s our turn. It’s happened to a lot of other industries, and this is a call to arms to distributors to rise up and fight back.&rdquo; </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link2">
			<h2 class="title">Growing Commoditization</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">The value distributors have historically brought to the market is unquestionable. Manufacturers gain geographic coverage for their products through the distribution channel, as well as sales, marketing and product availability they could not accomplish on their own. Customers gain assortment convenience, financing and technical support. It’s a simple model that’s worked for 150+ years.</p>
				<p class="p">But now, exclusive access to products is diminishing and &ldquo;channel complexity is exploding,&rdquo; Heller said. He predicts Amazon Business, for example, will eventually carry nearly all of the products a distributor sells. Amazon’s growing delivery capabilities, and those of others such as Uber Freight, are commoditizing delivery as well.</p>
				<p class="p">For some more perspective, Amazon since 2011 has gone up about 600% in enterprise valuation. Comparatively, Grainger has gone up by less than 10% in the same timeframe. A closer look at the growth of Amazon Business emphasizes the digital chasm that is spreading and strengthening Amazon’s advantage. Most distributors have not started examining the way customers behave online. Meanwhile, Amazon &mdash; with its ‘recommended for you’ and ‘related items,’ among other features &mdash; is perhaps the best in the world at the practice.</p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;They’re going to offer capabilities you can’t match. They’re going to do in B2B what they do in the consumer world, which has created an addictive process and experience,&rdquo; Heller said. &ldquo;But Amazon Business is just one marketplace &mdash; there will be others.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link3">
			<h2 class="title">The Internal Threat</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Traditionally, distributors evaluate the threat posed by the competition in terms of the capabilities of other national, regional and local distributors in the same market. But the digital age has brought about a new kind of competition, noted Justin King, owner of e-commerce consulting firm B2X Partners. &ldquo;What we need to be worried about is the company that says, ‘We want to build something on behalf of the customer. Not for our people, not for the systems that we have. On behalf of the customer,’&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p class="p">In the pursuit of the digital innovation required to keep up with Amazon and other digital native businesses, the attributes that have made distributors successful are the same elements that will hinder their future progress. To overcome this, distributors can start by analyzing and evaluating the processes they have built up over the years to run their business. For example, why charge for shipping at the time of shipment and not when the order is placed? Surely a customer would like to know how much they will be paying up front. There are many reasons for it, such as software that can’t calculate the dimensions of boxes. But the bottom line, King said, is processes such as these will continue to hold traditional distributors back.</p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;The company that kills you will look nothing like you,&rdquo; King said.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link4">
			<h2 class="title">A New Market Dynamic</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Aside from the fact that customers and employees alike are demanding digital transformation, the global market itself has changed to make it a requirement. Most companies today operate under what Michael Wu, chief AI strategist at SaaS provider PROS, calls the two-gears model. Every company has to acquire, and every company has to monetize &mdash; marketing and sales. But a new wave of technology in the form of digital media is disrupting that model.</p>
				<p class="p">Digitization is changing the traditional notion of customer acquisition. Today, the goal is to acquire peoples’ attention. Before the advent of the internet, that attention span was about 30 seconds. Now, it is down to 8.25 seconds. What does that mean for distributors looking to capture customers’ attention? &ldquo;You can monetize people as you capture their attention, but because their attention shifts away so quickly, that means you have to spend the money that you just earned from monetizing them to re-acquire them back,&rdquo; Wu said. &ldquo;This is a challenge.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">To meet that challenge, the two-gears model has evolved into four gears, adding engagement and enlistment. Customer engagement helps distributors sustain monetization, building a stronger relationship as the customer becomes increasingly loyal. Enlistment scales the distributor’s acquisitions, leveraging the customer to do something normally done inside of the company. &ldquo;Customer advocacy is a form of enlistment because customers are not obligated to advocate for you at all,&rdquo; said Wu. &ldquo;But if they are, then you’re going to acquire much more efficiently and much more effectively.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">The four-gear model is more scalable and more effective &mdash; as long as the gears are spinning in sync with the aid of digital technology.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link5">
			<h2 class="title">The Offensive Advantage</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Digital technology allows distributors to do more, but they have to actively take advantage of it, Wu said. This is where the final two gears of four-gear model will differentiate the companies that use them most effectively. Invest beyond simple sales and marketing to engage and enlist the customer through technology.</p>
				<p class="p">The defensive argument for investing in technology is companies that don’t digitally transform will no longer exist. But, Wu said, there is a strong offensive business advantage for those companies that do make the digital transformation journey.</p>
				<p class="p">As noted, market competitiveness is leading to mass commoditization in the industry. The best way to combat it, Wu said, is through differentiation. Traditionally, businesses persuaded their customers and prospects that their business was different through advertising. Today, digitally invested businesses are differentiating themselves through the experience their customers have in interacting with them, particularly online.</p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;What happens when you differentiate with customer experience? You don’t need to tell them anything. They will feel it for themselves,&rdquo; Wu explained. &ldquo;Not only is it more effective, it’s actually less replicable. It’s very hard to replicate a customer experience because every single touch point with a customer has to be replicated. People can copy your product, they will copy your service, but it’s very, very hard to copy the entire customer experience.&rdquo;</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link6">
			<h2 class="title">The Personalization Challenge</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">What’s the best avenue to optimizing customer experience? Personalization. But there are two challenges to achieving it, Wu noted. First, understating the customer. And second, actually delivering that unique experience for them. Ultimately, it is a data challenge &mdash; distributors need to have enough information on their customers to understand their preferences before they can deliver on them.</p>
				<p class="p">Historically, marketers have done look-alike analyses to understand their audience, but this is a limited approach in that the less data you have on a person, the more they appear to be similar to others. &ldquo;If you only look at one demographic, like gender, I actually look like half of the world’s population,&rdquo; Wu said. &ldquo;But if you have more data, if you have education, income level, their political orientation, their religious background, all this demographic information, then people look more and more unique.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">Big data allows for the tracking of thousands of behavior dimensions as well. Does the customer like to shop in the morning, or the evening? Do they prefer to be alone, or with others? &ldquo;When we have big data, there’s no excuse.</p>
				<p class="p">Every one of us should be treated uniquely,&rdquo; Wu added. &ldquo;The digital advantage helps you to personalize your customer experience.&rdquo; </p>
				<p class="p">The good news is, it’s much easier to collect a great deal of customer behavior data in the digital space: How many times they visit your website. How long they remain on a page. How often they revisit. All of these behaviors and much more can easily be monitored with the right technology.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link7">
			<h2 class="title">Own the Product Data</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Of course, in order to track data, distributors must have access to and ownership of it. It wouldn’t surprise most distributors to know that Amazon has become particularly adept at data tracking and management. Amazon Business surpassed $10 billion in annualized sales last year and is projected to reach $25 billion within a few years. As Heller noted, this level of sales growth could not be reached without partnering with outside distributors. But what is that relationship with Amazon costing those distributors in terms of data ownership?</p>
				<p class="p">Initially, Amazon allowed outside distributors to connect their own e-procurement systems to the Amazon platform. But now, Heller said, the company is positioning Amazon Business as a substitute for other procurement platforms entirely, using its leverage to gain product data from participating distributors.</p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;Amazon Business knows everything that’s coming through the system. They can figure out whether or not they want to carry it. They’re using the customer’s leverage to force distributors to give Amazon the data,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It’s a hugely powerful value proposition to the customer because it ends the ‘this item not found’ problem. They can still get rebates. They don’t have to buy any e-procurement platform. They don’t have to reconcile the data to a common taxonomy. Amazon Business does all of that.&rdquo;</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link8">
			<h2 class="title">Struggling with Change Management</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Amazon may have a significant head start, but the company does not own the entire $6 trillion-plus U.S. market. Distributors who make the commitment to change their business in order to be more competitive in the space should first understand that revolutionizing their digital and e-commerce capabilities is not a one-time project, but rather investing in a new ecosystem, said King.</p>
				<p class="p">Successful distributors understand that a commitment to such change starts with a commitment to effective change management organization-wide. &ldquo;My business would be a piece of cake if I didn’t have employees and if I didn’t have customers,&rdquo; King joked. &ldquo;The people in our organizations are the problem, and change management is about changing behavior. It’s about changing people. It’s about changing perceptions, and it is incredibly difficult.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">Distributors that have been successful with weaving digital into the DNA of their companies know that any new initiative is not about problem solving, he said, but rather proper change management. The first step is to get the executive team on board so that the company’s e-commerce strategy is a company-wide strategic initiative.</p>
				<p class="p">Often, it’s a daunting task because the executives don’t know where to start and what questions to ask along the way. Therefore, King said, they don’t know how to evaluate how well things are going. &ldquo;To understand it as a company, we have to develop a semantic language around e-commerce where we can all talk about e-commerce in the same terms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First as an executive team, and then throughout the whole organization.&rdquo;</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link9">
			<h2 class="title">Benchmarking Terms</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">What would a language look like? There are two parts of e-commerce, according to King. One, how distributors acquire customers (customer acquisition). And two, how current customers are using the website (customer adoption). By breaking these two elements down as a whole company, distributors can develop an internal language to talk about e-commerce, King said.</p>
				<p class="p">First, acquisition. When acquiring new customers digitally, distributors need to drive relevant traffic to their website. This requires understanding the key words that people are using to search on Google or other search engines, social media, any source that will drive traffic to the distributor’s website. Then, once they are on the site, they need to be converted into customers. The executive team should all know the language of the metrics required to achieve this action, King said. &ldquo;If part of your strategy is to acquire customers, then your executive team should all know that we’re driving traffic, we’re tracking our conversions, and we’re tracking how we expand our average order value, our AOV,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
				<p class="p">Second, adoption. Executives should understand that adoption is not looking for a new customer, but rather serving an existing customer, King added. This includes getting customers registered on the website so that their login can be integrated with the distributor’s ERP in order to show them their unique pricing, contract, location-based products &mdash; all of the ways to create the unique buying experiences discussed by Wu as necessary to meet the personalization challenge in the digital age.</p>
				<p class="p">A registered customer is a trackable customer. &ldquo;This type of framework gives you the ability to brainstorm at the micro level instead of the macro level. At a high resolution versus a low resolution. So instead of asking questions like, ‘Hey, how do we go from 5% of revenue to 20% of revenue?’ &mdash; which is a really generic question &mdash; We can say, ‘Well, to go from 5% to 20%, we need to either drive traffic or do better in conversions or need to increase average order value,’&rdquo; said King. &ldquo;Those are easy brainstorming sessions to have within your company.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">With a common lexicon, executive teams can work together to answer critical e-commerce questions within the company, King added:  &ldquo;Have a common language and talk about these different things with your executive team,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get on the same page, understand what the words and the terms mean.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">With the right language defined among the executive team, Wu recommended creating a clear vision of what digital transformation means for the entire organization. At its core, digital transformation is a buzzword that simply means leveraging digital technology to help a business transform the way it operates. It’s up to the individual company to define what that means.</p>
				<p class="p">There are a multitude of digital technologies out there, all designed to transform many different parts of a business. As a result, digital transformation for one company may mean using social media to engage with customers, while another may see it as leveraging big data to make sales predictions. Another may bring in computer tablets to onboard new employees and consider itself digitally transformed.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link10">
			<h2 class="title">Digital Evangelist</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">With the vision in place, someone within the organization needs to own the digital strategy. Be it a digital branch manager, head of e-commerce, head of customer experience, there should be a point person within the organization who evangelizes the digital transformation effort, said King. Perhaps counterintuitively, the leader does not necessarily need to be technologically savvy, but they must be the No. 1 change agent within the organization. Don’t be afraid to look outside the industry for this position, he added &mdash; &ldquo;It’s a lot easier to hire someone with some e-commerce skills and teach them your business than it is to teach e-commerce to someone inside of your business.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">Next, King recommended finding the top company advocates within the organization &mdash; the people respected by everyone &mdash; and turning them into change agents as well. This is important because with any change effort employees can become fearful of losing their jobs to technology. A distributor’s internal tech advocates can reinforce the message that technology is there as a tool to help the sales team sell, for example, not automate them out of a job.</p>
				<p class="p">Identify these concerns within the workforce and commit to addressing them. This process can take a year or longer, King noted. He recommended monthly meetings to discuss the transition, both group gatherings and one-on-one conversations. There will be people within the organization who are staunchly against a digital initiative. For example, employees who are within a couple of years of retirement and don’t have the drive to learn new technology.</p>
				<p class="p">&ldquo;Those people exist. We’ve got to find them, we’ve got to address those workforce concerns head on, and address them consistently,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;Know this is not a few-weeks project, it’s months or even a couple of years of addressing these workforce concerns.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">King drew on his experience working at Oracle, an organization he said excelled at implementing change within the business. How did they do it? Through adjusting their compensation structure to align with the new initiative and misalign with everything that was counter to it. King has personally worked with other companies where the executive team, all the way up to the CEO, will base their bonus off of how well their e-commerce and digital efforts are going.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link11">
			<h2 class="title">A Lasting Strategy</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Moving forward, said Wu, the digital strategy has to be customer-centric in order to prevent the problem of cross-departmental misalignment that arises because most departments have differing key performance indicators and operating constraints. &ldquo;Each department is trying to maximize the KPI under their constraints, regardless of other departments,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you actually have a customer-centric strategy, that unites the whole company together.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">King agreed, the customer must come first. Distributors can ensure that happens, he said, by using tools that will do customer journey mapping &mdash; creating a visual representation of every interaction customers have with the organization.</p>
				<p class="p">In the digital age, people want efficiency and speed, but the pursuit of these abilities should not come at the expense of creating an exceptional e-commerce customer journey. When do customers want to spend time with distributors? The answer, said Wu, is before they buy. They want answers: Do you have the product? How much does it cost? When will it arrive? &ldquo;That’s why search is so important,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They need to explore, so you need to engage them in that process.&rdquo; </p>
				<p class="p">Indeed, there are three factors distributors need to keep in in mind to ensure their e-commerce abilities are up to par, said King: &ldquo;Improve the search on your website. Improve the search on your website. Improve the search on your website.&rdquo; </p>
				<p class="p">King has conducted more than 4,000 inter-views of distribution end customers and the first thing they say is, &ldquo;We type in hammers and we don’t get hammers. We type in fasteners and we don’t get fasteners. Bolts and we don’t get bolts. Water heaters, we don’t get water heaters.&rdquo; The search function must be effective and keeping it updated is an ongoing program, King added, not a project with an end date.</p>
				<p class="p">After this pre-purchase journey comes the purchase and ultimately, the post-purchase journey. Referring back to the four-gear model of business operations, this is the part where engagement and enlistment come in to sync up and spin harmoniously with sales and marketing, Wu said. &ldquo;After they buy, you can actually enlist them, ask them, ‘How do you like the product? What was your experience like?’ These are the two gears where people do actually want to spend time with you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text-anchors" id="link12">
			<h2 class="title">More Than a Project</h2>
			<div class="text-anchors__item">
				<p class="p">Finally, to achieve lasting digital transformation, distributors should keep in mind that the process starts out small, often within one siloed department, Wu added. The majority of the business will still be operating within the company’s legacy technology system. For this reason, he said, it’s critical that new technology be able to integrate with the old. &ldquo;If you don’t integrate with your legacy system, you’re going to remain siloed,&rdquo; Wu said. &ldquo;You’re not going to be able to transform the entire company.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="p">On average, it takes up to a year to train employees on the internal operations of an ERP, both Wu and King noted. In choosing a new technology vendor to partner with, keep ease of use top of mind, they said. &ldquo;With very limited digital talent, digital maturity, your people have to be able to use that technology right away,&rdquo; said Wu. &ldquo;They have to realize efficiency &mdash; with very little training &mdash; right away. It often starts with a technology department project. But eventually, it must permeate the entire company, and actually change the people, the process and the culture as well, in order to change your company and in order for this transformation to last. If it doesn’t last, it’s not a transformation. It’s a project.&rdquo;</p>
